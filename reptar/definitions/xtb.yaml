  xtb_scc_accuracy:
    description: >+
      SCC accuracy level in MD.
      Every 10th step the SCC is properly converged at sccconv=1.0.
      sccmd should be < 5 in critical cases, effects may show up as bad thermostating

      Each potential is described with a dictionary (with its own definitions) in a list.
      ``sphere_radius`` is the radius of the confining potential in Angstroms.
